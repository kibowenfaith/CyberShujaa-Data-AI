## 🧩 Tasks Overview

### 🧮 Part 1: Data Parsing (10 Marks)
- Parsed raw text data into structured format  
- Extracted fields: brand, model, year, mileage, and price  
- Created a clean Pandas DataFrame  

### 🧼 Part 2: Data Wrangling & Preparation (30 Marks)
- Cleaned columns (e.g., `milage` → numeric)
- Converted accident column to boolean
- Created derived columns: `car_age`, `horsepower`
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies  

### 📊 Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (35 Marks)
Visualized and explored relationships between key variables:
- Histogram of `price`
- Scatter plot of `milage` vs `price`
- Box and violin plots for `accident` and `fuel_type`
- Extracted insights on price influencers

### 📈 Part 4: Tableau Dashboard (25 Marks)
Built an interactive dashboard with:
- **KPI cards** for average price, mileage, and total cars  
- **Bar chart** for top 10 brands by average price  
- **Pie chart** for accident vs clean history  
- **Scatter plot** for price vs car age  
- **Filters** for brand, fuel_type, and accident  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
1. Car prices **decrease with mileage**.  
2. Cars with **accident history** show **lower median prices**.  
3. **Brand and fuel type** significantly affect price distribution.
